## Unknown (037-066)
For whatever reason, at this point they decided to move away from both releasing cards in sets of 9 and releasing cards whose backgrounds can be joined together to make a large picture. They did return to releasing 9 card sets after this, but where this set was also released without being a multiple of 9 itself, 9 card-per-page binders now become out of sync if the cards are listed numerically.

Card #048 is shown below as an example of how these cards all look.

## 2005 - Poképark (076-084)
These were given out at Pokémon The Park circus-like theme parks between March 18th and September 25th 2005. The front of each card promotes an attraction at the PokéPark.

|#|Name
|:--|:--
|076|くるくるシップ ((Lugia's) Spinning Ship)
|077|🇦 *Japanese?*  (Pokémon Merry-Go-Round)
|078|🇦 *Japanese?*  (Twister: Fury in the Sky)
|079|ピカチュウの森 (Pikachu Forest)
|080|⚠️  *Information required.*
|081|🇦 *Japanese?* ((Mudkip's) Big Splash)
|082|わんぱくトレイン ((The Pichu Brothers') Rascal Railway)
|083|クラッシュカーバトル (Bumper Car Battle (Team Aqua vs. Team Magma))
|084|🇦 *Japanese?* (Pokémon Star Swing)

There were actually 11 different attractions at PokéPark, but only 9 made it onto the cards. Bulbapedia has some detail about each in their [PokéPark (theme park)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9Park_(theme_park)) wiki entry (not much though).

I'm not able to read or write Japanese. I'm not sure what the Japanese names of each of the below cards are:

## 2005 - Lucario and the Mystery of Mew (085-093)

Similar to the Poképark cards above, this set also features 9 cards whose backgrounds make up the movie poster for Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Note that the images below are not the exact images the cards make up, as I was unable to find the exact poster.

The cards can be arranged together in the following way:
