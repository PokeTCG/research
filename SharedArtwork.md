# Shared Artwork
This page documents Pokémon which appear in the artwork of other Pokémon cards.

**⚠️  This is a work-in-progress!**

Research is still being carried out on this list. There is still a lot to do before it's anywhere near complete.

As an example, the below card is a Slowbro from the Undaunted set:

Nowhere in the card's text does it mention Chikorita or Cyndaquil, two Pokémon also featured in the card's artwork. This usually means that you won't find this card when searching for "Chikorita" or "Cyndaquil", even though a collector of those cards may like to have this in their collection.
