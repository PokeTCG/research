# Poképark Adventure Cards

This document sets out to list all Japanese *Adventure Cards* which were given out at Pokémon The Park circus-like theme parks between March 18th and September 25th 2005.

The front of each card promotes attractions at the Poképark. The back, however, acts as a puzzle, whereby aligning multiple cards together will form a large picture made up of various different Pokémon, which ends up looking like this:

In total there are only 9 cards in this set. If anyone knows why they start at 076, I'd love to know.

Below is a representation of how each card fits together to form the above image. You'll notice that not all of the cards are fully contained within the image; that's because the image above has been slightly cropped.
